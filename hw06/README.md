# HW06 - Video into Sound, or Video into Drawing

In class we looked at two example of how to process video, one generating sound and the other creating a visualization. For this assignment, develop one of those processes further. If you've worked with Tone before, or you're more interested in sound, you can pursue that path. Otherwise you can do more drawing based on video data.

### Description
If you choose to do some drawing based on video analysis, you might start from the optical flow example that we looked at in class. You're also free to take another one of the Computer Vision examples from Kyle's page and to start from there. If you'd rather work from face data instead, start from the face tracking example. Rather than sending out particles from the points of optical flow, do something else. Things you might experiment with:

#### Video
- Drawing text based on movement
- Distorting a shape using video movement
- Directing a swarm of particles using the edges in the video
- Giving the video an animated color depending on movement
- Making an "instagram filter" by drawing shapes or images on top of the face

#### Audio
- Add an audio effect to the processing chain, like reverb, filter or distortion. Control this with the face or with movement.
- Control the playback of an audio file using the video, perhaps adjusting its speed using the position of your face.
- Play a chord of multiple different notes. Maybe one note is controlled by each eye, and a third with the mouth.

### Requirements
There are no hard requirements for this assignment, except that it must use Computer Vision in some way. So, it could be based on one of the CV examples from Kyle's page, or it could use the face tracking data from the ml5 example. You should also try to go beyond simply tweaking what we did in class.
